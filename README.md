## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
 
* PyBullet
* [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/)
* Python 3+
* Numpy
* Anaconda for environment management is recommended

### Installing

*How should they install the application. E.g. download the trunk and launch within the UnityEditor.*

*Include an image/animated GIF of what success looks like.*

### Building

*Describe how to build the application and general settings. Any specific should be included in specific guides on the wiki / pages section. What is needed to build should be already be included in prerequisites*

### Running the tests

No tests are implemented for this project.

### Coding Style

Coding style adheres to AMRC coding practices.

## Deployment

*Describe how you deploy the built application. Just an .exe that is run vs pointing to specific guides on the wiki / pages.*
