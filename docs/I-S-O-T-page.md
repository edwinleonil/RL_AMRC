# Installation, Setup, Operation and Troubleshooting

This page will contain all required information regarding the Installation, Setup, Operation and Troubleshooting for the final project deliverable. You should be able to take the Method Statement and translate most of it into this document.

**Installation**

Installation will be the first time the user is using the demonstrator. If the demonstrator includes equipment that they need to setup before they can use it, you can refer them to the instructions provided with said equipment (e.g if a VR kit was purchased, state that they should follow the instructions provided with the VR kit to set up.)

**Setup**

This section will include information for checks and tasks to be completed before normal use. This can be copied from the Method Statement Pre-task checks section.

**Operation**

This section will include the required information for operating the demonstrator. This will basic details covering how the normal operating procedure, how to access different functionality, and the user controls (if required). Somme of this can be copied from the Method Statement Method / Sequence of operations and Post-task checks sections.

**Troubleshooting**

Troubleshooting will contain the known issues with the software and possible solutions for them (if they have them). We should be able to take the Github Issues tab and copy them into this section.
